## Support

There are lots of ways for you to get support and help while volunteering as a translator, reviewer or tester:

1.	We give you access to lots of support materials which explain how to use Crowdin, how to translate different types of files, how to translate code, and so on. We also have a translation checklist that you can use at the end of each task to ensure you have not missed anything.

2.	At least one member of our translation team is available on Slack every working day so you can ask them any questions you like. You can also ask questions directly in Crowdin or in Jira, or you can send us an email.

3.	We have language coordinators for various language teams; they are experienced volunteers who are always ready and happy to help, even if you belong to a different language team. Simply ask a question in the general channel on Slack and someone is guaranteed to help you out.
